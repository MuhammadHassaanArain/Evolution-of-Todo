## Prompt

```text
# Implementation Guide: Phase I – Todo In-Memory CLI

## Objective
Generate all code using **Claude Code** in Python 3.13+ with **UV package manager**. No manual coding.

---

## Steps

1. **Setup**
   - Initialize project folders (`models/`, `services/`, `cli/`) and `main.py`.
   - Create Python env: `uv create-env todo-env python=3.13 && uv activate todo-env`.

2. **Task Model**
   - Generate `Task` class: `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`.
   - Use in-memory list for storage.

3. **Features**
   - Add Task → `add_task(title, description)`
   - View Tasks → `view_tasks()`
   - Update Task → `update_task(task_id, title=None, description=None)`
   - Delete Task → `delete_task(task_id)`
   - Mark Complete/Incomplete → `toggle_task_completion(task_id, status)`

4. **CLI**
   - Menu: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete/Incomplete, Exit.
   - Capture input, call services, show messages.

5. **Testing**
   - Verify all features work in-memory via console.
   - Refine specs and regenerate if needed.

6. **Delivery**
   - Include `constitution.md`, `/specs/history/`, `/src/`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
   - App runs end-to-end without errors.

---

**Notes:**
- Follow **Spec-Driven Development**.
- Keep architecture compatible for future phases.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the Todo CLI application following the specification and plan. All 72 tasks from tasks.md have been completed across 10 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup - Project structure created with proper directories
2. Phase 2: Foundational - Task model and in-memory storage implemented
3. Phase 3: US1 - Add New Task functionality implemented
4. Phase 4: US2 - View All Tasks functionality implemented
5. Phase 5: US3 - Mark Task Complete/Incomplete functionality implemented
6. Phase 6: US4 - Update Task functionality implemented
7. Phase 7: US5 - Delete Task functionality implemented
8. Phase 8: CLI Integration - Complete menu-driven interface implemented
9. Phase 9: Testing - Unit and integration tests created and passing
10. Phase 10: Polish - Error handling, validation, and documentation completed

Key accomplishments:
- Created clean architecture with models, services, and CLI layers
- Implemented all 5 required features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Toggle)
- All operations work in-memory as required by constitution
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests (29 tests, all passing)
- Proper error handling and input validation
- Full CLI menu interface with clear prompts and messages
- All code generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)

The application has been tested and all functionality works as specified in the requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Todo CLI application with all required features implemented
- 🧪 Tests: 29 tests created and all passing (100% success rate)
- 📁 Files: Created src/, tests/, requirements.txt, README.md, and all implementation files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Application is ready for use or further development
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully followed spec-driven development approach with no manual coding

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial validation issues fixed (2 failing tests)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tests passing
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Deploy or enhance with additional features
