# Todo CLI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All code must originate from written specs. Application logic is generated exclusively by Claude Code based on clear, detailed specifications before any implementation work begins.

### II. No Manual Coding
Application logic is generated exclusively by Claude Code. No handwritten business logic is permitted - all features must be implemented through AI-assisted generation from specifications.

### III. In-Memory Only
No files, databases, or persistence mechanisms. The application operates entirely in memory with no external storage dependencies, ensuring simplicity and speed for the initial implementation.

### IV. Clarity First
Simple, readable, maintainable structure is prioritized over complexity. Code must be easily understood and maintained, with clear naming conventions and type hints throughout.

### V. Future-Compatible Architecture
The implementation must not block later web, AI, or cloud phases. Architecture decisions should maintain compatibility with future evolution of the application.

### VI. Test-First Development
All features must have comprehensive tests written before implementation. Each feature requires dedicated spec and acceptance criteria to ensure proper functionality.

## Required Features
All Basic Level features must be implemented:
- Add task (title, description)
- View all tasks
- Update task
- Delete task by ID
- Mark task complete / incomplete

Each feature requires a dedicated spec and acceptance criteria before implementation.

## Technical Standards
- Python 3.13+ required
- UV for execution and dependency management
- Clean project structure under `/src`
- Use type hints and clear naming conventions
- Console-based interaction only

## Specification Rules
- Specs written in Markdown format
- Stored in `/specs/history/`
- Specs must fully describe behavior before code generation
- Each feature must have acceptance criteria defined

## Constraints
- ❌ No databases or files for persistence
- ❌ No web frameworks
- ❌ No external APIs
- ❌ No handwritten business logic
- ✅ In-memory data only

## Deliverables
Repository must contain:
- `constitution.md`
- `/specs/history/`
- `/src/` (Claude-generated code)
- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

## Success Criteria
- All 5 features work via CLI
- Code fully generated by Claude Code
- Specs clearly map to behavior
- App runs without errors
- All requirements met per specification

## Enforcement
Any violation of these principles requires spec revision and regeneration of the affected code components.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All development work must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of the change, approval process, and migration plan if needed. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
