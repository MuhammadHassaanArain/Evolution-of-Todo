## Prompt

```text
# Constitution – Phase I: In-Memory Todo CLI

## Project
**The Evolution of Todo – Phase I**
Python In-Memory Console Application

---

## Purpose
Establish a clean, spec-driven foundation by building a Python CLI Todo app using **Claude Code** and **Spec-Kit Plus**, with **no manual coding**.

---

## Core Principles
- **Spec-Driven Development**: All code must originate from written specs.
- **No Manual Coding**: Application logic is generated exclusively by Claude Code.
- **In-Memory Only**: No files, databases, or persistence.
- **Clarity First**: Simple, readable, maintainable structure.
- **Future-Compatible**: Must not block later web, AI, or cloud phases.

---

## Required Features
All Basic Level features must be implemented:
- Add task (title, description)
- View all tasks
- Update task
- Delete task by ID
- Mark task complete / incomplete

Each feature requires a dedicated spec and acceptance criteria.

---

## Technical Standards
- **Python 3.13+**
- **UV** for execution
- Clean project structure under `/src`
- Use type hints and clear naming
- Console-based interaction only

---

## Specification Rules
- Specs written in Markdown
- Stored in `/specs/history/`
- Specs must fully describe behavior before code generation

---

## Constraints
- ❌ No databases or files
- ❌ No web frameworks
- ❌ No external APIs
- ❌ No handwritten business logic
- ✅ In-memory data only

---

## Deliverables
Repository must contain:
- `constitution.md`
- `/specs/history/`
- `/src/` (Claude-generated code)
- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Success Criteria
- All 5 features work via CLI
- Code fully generated by Claude Code
- Specs clearly map to behavior
- App runs without errors

---

## Enforcement
Any violation requires spec revision and regeneration.

_End_
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution template with the provided content, creating a comprehensive constitution for the Todo CLI project. The new constitution includes:
- Core principles emphasizing spec-driven development, no manual coding, in-memory only, clarity first, and future-compatible architecture
- Required features: add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks
- Technical standards requiring Python 3.13+, UV, clean structure, type hints
- Specification rules for markdown specs in /specs/history/
- Constraints prohibiting databases, web frameworks, external APIs, and handwritten business logic
- Deliverables and success criteria
- Version 1.0.0 with ratification date of 2025-12-27

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial project constitution for Todo CLI
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with comprehensive constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with feature specification and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now provides clear guidance for spec-driven development approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin feature specification
